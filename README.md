# About the System
This is a project to create an IoT-based monitoring and automatic draining system for murky water using a 3rd party application, namely blynk IoT 2.0. 
## Hardware
This system uses ESP32 as a microcontroller 
## the sensor are as follows:
1. PH-4502c sensor
2. Turbidity sensor
3. DS18b20 temperature sensor
4. HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
## the actuators used are as follows:
1. SG90 Servo
2. 2-channel Relay
3. DS1307 RTC.
4. lcd i2c (16x2)
## the wiring diagram is as follows:
